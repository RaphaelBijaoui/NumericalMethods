As defined in spec.pdf, as part of ELEC95018 Mathematics 2C: Numerical Analysis, we were tasked to work on five different exercises, focusing on the numerical analysis of ordinary and partial differential equations with the help of MATLAB. 

Three second order Runge-Kutta methods are covered throughout the course of this project, namely Heunâ€™s method, midpoint method, and a method of our choice. Following this, we applied the Gauss-Seidel relaxation method, followed by an adaptation of it with Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR).

Numerical methods are mathematical methods that find/approximate the solution to complicated problems, by reducing it to a series of addition, subtraction, or multiplication operations. It provides a fast solution to many mathematical problems which are present in various fields of engineering.

By annotating the relevant MATLAB code, explaining the results, and elaborating the mathematical processes behind the results in our Project Report, we aim to provide a concise explanation of how numerical methods can be used to solve problems faced by engineers in the modern world.

## Setup
First, if you haven't already, make sure you have MATLAB installed on your local machine! 
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/">This link</a> should help facilitate that.

Next, ensure you have this project locally. Run this command in terminal, from the folder you would like the file to be in.
```
git clone https://github.com/RaphaelBijaoui/NumericalMethods.git
```
Open Matlab and from there, open the folder you just downloaded.

Now for the fun stuff!
